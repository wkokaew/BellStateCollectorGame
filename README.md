# BellStateCollectorGame
This project is a part of the Quantum Explorers event.

- all dependencies are stored in `requirements.txt`
- To run the game, run `python BCS.py`
- The game aims to collect a quantum gate (CNOT and H) to build Bell states by controlling qubits. Some gates have a lot of noise trying to distract you. Collect more to unlock rewards.
- Here are the examples of the gameplay:
1. Begining: you have to control your qubit to collect H and CNOT gates

3. Once hitting the wall or itself, it's game over, and reset the score.
4. Show your score!

- Next features: adding more skills for qubits and more challenges.
